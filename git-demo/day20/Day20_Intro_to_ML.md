# Task 1: The Paradigm Shift (Traditional vs. Machine Learning)
Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a method that allows computers to learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed with fixed rules. In traditional programming, we give the computer data and clearly written rules to produce an output.

 For example, if we want to detect spam emails using traditional programming, we would manually write rules like “if the email contains the word ‘lottery’, mark it as spam.” 
 
 In contrast, in Machine Learning, we provide the computer with many emails along with their correct labels (spam or not spam), and the system automatically learns patterns that identify spam.
 
  This approach is powerful because it can handle complex problems where writing all possible rules manually is difficult.
